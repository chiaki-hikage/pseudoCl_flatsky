This is the code for computing psuedo Cl from the masked/weighted shear in flat approximation.
The code includes the following files

 README
 Makefile 
 iparam.sh : a shell script to set parameters (grid number, box size...)
 iparam.f90 : set basic parameters
 default.inp : default parameters for iparam.f90
 test.sh: a shell script to test the shear power reconstruction
 sheardist.f90 : make a shear catalog from Gaussian shear fields
 starmask.f90 : simulate mask of weak lensing data 
 maskinfo.f90 : set parameters for simulated masks
 modemat_square.f90 : compute mode coupling matrix of a square patch of sky
 modemat_inside.f90 : compute mode coupling matrix of the simulated mask
 shearpow.f90 : compute the shear power spectrum from shear catalogs
 deconv.f90 : (de)convolve the shear power spectrum
 collect.f90 : collect files of output power spectrum into one file
 sub.f90 : subroutines

To run the code, 

 * "make setparam" to set parameters (e.g., grid number, box size, binnings)
 * "make all" to compile codes 
 * "make test" to test reconstruction method using Gaussian shear fields 
   it may take about 5mins
 
You can see the results of binned power spectrum in the file "sumpow.dat"

   1st line: l
   2nd line: input power (convergence)
   3rd line: deconvolved power (E-mode shear)
   4th line: convolved power (E-mode shear)
   5th line: masked power (E-mode shear)
   6-9th line: same as 2-5th line but for B-mode shear power
